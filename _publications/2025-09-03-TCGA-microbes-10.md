title: "Comprehensive analysis of microbial content in whole-genome sequencing samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas project."
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'In recent years, a growing number of publications have reported the presence of microbial species in human tumors and mixtures of microbes that appear to be highly specific to different cancer types. \[...\] Our results expand upon and reinforce our recent findings, which show that the presence of microbes is far smaller than had been previously reported and that many species identified in TCGA data might not be present at all.'
