title: "Genomic Next-Token Predictors are In-Context Learners."
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
excerpt: 'We develop a controlled experimental framework comprising symbolic reasoning tasks instantiated in both linguistic and genomic forms, enabling direct comparison of ICL across genomic and linguistic models. Our results show that genomic models, like their linguistic counterparts, exhibit log-linear gains in pattern induction as the number of in-context demonstrations increases.'
