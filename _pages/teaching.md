## EN.601.449/649 Applied Comparative Genomics

I was the sole TA for Johns Hopkins' EN.601.449/649 Applied Comparative Genomics course during Fall 2025. As the class transitioned to incorporate more deep learning, I helped refine the assignments, exam content, and lectures. Below are the slides for two lectures I delivered about applying deep learning to genomics research.

## Deep Learning in Genomics Journal Club

Although not an official teaching role, I am a co-founder (alongside [Kuan-Hao Chao](https://khchao.com/)) and organizer of the Johns Hopkins Deep Learning in Genomics Journal Club. When I first began to explore deep learning for genomics, I felt overwhelmed by the enormous amount of literature to catch up on, as well as lonely because I was the only person in my lab studying this field. I wanted to help build a community at Hopkins of students who were interested in this subject so that we could learn together, share ideas, and mutually improve our understanding. We meet biweekly, with one of our members presenting on a topic of interest. I have presented three times so far (slides below), but I encourage anyone interested to check out [our website](https://jhu-deep-learning-in-genomics.github.io/) for more great presentations :)
