## Applied Comparative Genomics

I was the sole TA for Johns Hopkins' EN.601.449/649 Applied Comparative Genomics course during Fall 2025. As the class transitioned to incorporate more deep learning, I helped refine the assignments, exam content, and lectures. Below are the slides for two lectures I delivered about applying deep learning to genomics research.
